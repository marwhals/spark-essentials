   * Questions:
   *
   * 1. Which zones have the most pickups/dropoffs overall?
   * 2. What are the peak hours for taxi?
   * 3. How are the trips distributed by length? Why are people taking the cab?
   * 4. What are the peak hours for long/short trips?
   * 5. What are the top 3 pickup/dropoff zones for long/short trips?
   * 6. How are people paying for the ride, on long/short trips?
   * 7. How is the payment type evolving with time?
   * 8. Can we explore a ride-sharing opportunity by grouping close short trips?
